# NDAGIJIMANA JEAN DE DIEU 
## ABOUT ME 

My name is JEAN DE DIEU NDAGIJIMANA, and I am currently a student in University of Rwanda, college of science and technology, taking production and manufacturing option in mechanical engineering.
currently, I am working on the design of my project about prosthetic hand, Smart wheelchair and looking for how I can embed them with programmed instructions, is in that way I’m taking training of software embedded system at kLab and a short course online about Arduino IDE and coding.  By now I’m good in C and C++ programing language as it is the one I’m using in Arduino coding. And recently, I’ve been working on the design of NISSANI GTR suspension in SOLIDWORKS and I’m done for it. For all these I have their models. I’m good in CAD and terrific in SOLIDWORKS, with SOLIDWORKS I am able to design any model.  It’s not only SOLIDWORKS but also other softwares, for instance I’m using TINKERCAD in simulation of Arduino circuit system and in the training we did about 3D printing we were using Autodesk inventor to model and UltimakerCura to generate G-codes for CNC machine or 3D printers, so it is understood that I’m skillful to CAD, in few I’m good in modelling, simulation and optimization.
In real life, I like to share what I got to others, for instance, I created a group of students where we get connected and do on some projects and helping each other in CAD especially SOLIDWORKS and I am very sure that if you come in our class and ask for 10 students who are skilled in modeling using soliidworks you can get 7 of them are from in my group that I created, so here you can understand that I like to share what I got to others.

### So, about my educational background:

As I said before, currently I’m doing mechanical production engineering at university of Rwanda college of science and technology sincce 2021, now I’m in year 3. I have consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to learning and maintaining my performance marks above 70s from year 1. I’m particularly drawn to subjects like technical drawing, CAD/CAM and embedded system because the technical drawing is the language of engineers and CAD/CAM contribute to industry 4.0 for the integration of intelligent digital technologies like AI, IOT… into manufacturing and industrial processes and embedded system is very important in mechanical field because it interconnect mechanical system with electrical and programs to be controlled for specific purpose.
Yeah, from 2017 to 2019 I did Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics (PCM) in advanced level at Lycee de Kigali. I’d been performed well and I was given an academic performance award in 2018. I gained there a leadership skills and contributed to the development of science club in our school. For instance, I’d been a member and a leader in science club, mathematics club, media club and Croix-rouge (Red crox) club since 2018-2019. And I did my ordinary level at Rusumo High School. I also had been performing well there.
Knowledge and skills:

I’m skillful to 3D printing because I attended one month trainings (in 2023) provided by NIRDA & UR-CST in partnership with GIZ held at NIRDA and 4 weeks training 3D printing provided by FabLab held at FABLAB Kacyiru.
I’m knowledgeable to Artificial Intelligent(AI), Internet of Things (IoT) and industry 4.0 because I attended ROBOTICS COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE event held at Zora Bot Africa on 26th October 2023.
I’m terrific skillful in CAD software especially solidworks and MatLab, I have a budge on linkedIn of solidworks passed quizzes. And here I am able to model, simulate and make optimization.

Additionally, I am doing on a project about a modernized irigation, the progress will be shown right here.




 ## PROJECT TITLE: SMART IRRIGATION

This project develops a smart irrigation system using sensor, pump, and control nodes to optimize water usage in agriculture by monitoring soil moisture, weather conditions, and water flow. It aims to conserve water, enhance crop yield and quality, and promote sustainability. Hardware includes sensors, communication modules, actuators, power supplies, and infrastructure. Software encompasses firmware, communication protocols, data processing, and a user interface. The system achieves its goals through real-time monitoring, automated control, precision irrigation, and data analysis, ultimately offering water and energy savings, increased yields, improved crop quality, and positive environmental impacts.
  
## Objective:
 the main  goal of smart irrigation is to support sustainable agriculture practices, enhance food security for future generations, and promote environmental stewardship.

### Conservation:
Smart irrigation aims to optimize water usage in agricultural settings by precisely monitoring soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and crop water requirements.
### Improve Crop Yield and Quality:
By maintaining optimal soil moisture levels and providing plants with the water they need for healthy growth, smart irrigation systems contribute to enhanced productivity and profitability for farmers. 
### Real-time Monitoring and Data Analysis: 
These systems continuously collect and analyze data on soil moisture, weather conditions, and irrigation practices. 


 # Hardware Components
## Sensors
### Soil Moisture Sensors:
Measure soil moisture levels to determine when irrigation is needed.
### Weather Sensors:
Include temperature, humidity, rain, and light sensors to monitor environmental conditions.
### Flow Sensors:
Measure the flow rate of water to ensure proper irrigation.
# Nodes
### Sensor Nodes: 
Nodes that collect data from sensors in the field. These are typically distributed throughout the irrigation area.
### Pump Nodes: 
Control the activation of pumps to distribute water to different parts of the irrigation system.
### Control Node:
Acts as the central hub, collecting data from sensor nodes, processing information, and sending commands to pump nodes.
# Connectivity and Communication
### Communication Modules:
Use wireless communication technologies like LoRa, Zigbee, Wi-Fi, or cellular to connect the nodes.
### Microcontrollers: 
Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi, or similar to process data and manage communication.
# Actuators
### Pumps:
Pumps to deliver water to different zones.
 ### Valves:
 Solenoid valves to control water flow in specific sections.
 # Power Supply
### Batteries:
To power nodes in the field. Solar panels can be used for sustainable energy.
### Voltage Regulators:
To ensure consistent power supply to the nodes and sensors.
# Infrastructure
### Pipes and Tubing: 
For water distribution.
### Mounting Equipment: 
For sensors and nodes.

# Software Components
# Firmware
### Microcontroller Firmware: 
Programmed to read sensors, process data, and communicate with other nodes.
### Pump Control Logic: 
Controls when pumps are activated based on data received from sensor nodes.
# Communication Protocols
### Wireless Communication Protocols:
Define how nodes communicate with each other (e.g., MQTT, CoAP).
### Cloud Connectivity: 
If using cloud-based monitoring, you need a protocol for communication with the cloud.
# Data Processing and Analytics
### Data Processing Software:
Processes sensor data to make decisions on irrigation.
### Machine Learning/AI: 
(Optional) For predictive analytics and optimization.
# User Interface
Web/Mobile Application: Allows users to monitor and control the irrigation system remotely.
Dashboard: Displays sensor data, system status, and control options.
