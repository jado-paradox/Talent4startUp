A SMART IRRIGATION
Overview
This project aims to develop a smart irrigation system using sensor nodes, pump nodes, and control nodes. The system will optimize water usage for agricultural purposes by monitoring soil moisture levels, environmental conditions, and water flow, and adjusting irrigation accordingly.
Hardware Components
•	Sensors: Soil moisture sensors, weather sensors, and flow sensors.
•	Nodes: Sensor nodes, pump nodes, and control nodes.
•	Connectivity: Communication modules, microcontrollers.
•	Actuators: Pumps, solenoid valves.
•	Power Supply: Batteries, voltage regulators.
•	Infrastructure: Pipes, tubing, mounting equipment.
Software Components
•	Firmware: Microcontroller firmware for data processing and control.
•	Communication Protocols: Wireless communication protocols.
•	Data Processing and Analytics: Software for sensor data processing.
•	User Interface: Web/mobile application for monitoring and control.
Getting Started
•	Installation instructions will be provided here once available.
•	Usage guidelines will be provided here once available.
•	Contributing guidelines will be provided here once available.
